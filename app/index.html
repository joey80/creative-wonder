            <p>In our preschools and at home, we should make "come to me for help" one of the first

          <span class="chalkboard__accordion__question">What should I do if my child is sick?</span>
          <div class="chalkboard__accordion__answer">
            <p>Please do not send a sick child to school. If a child arrives with symptoms of illness, the child will
            not be permitted to stay. Children will be excluded from contact with the other children; seated with the
            staff at the front desk until parents can be notified. Please notify us if your child becomes ill and will
            not be attending that day. We ask that parents notify us when their child contracts a communicable disease.
            The preschool will notify all other parents about any communicable disease outbreaks (This does not name
            the child involved just the classroom to indicate highest exposure). A child will not be permitted to attend
            preschool when he or she have vomited or had diarrhea during the previous 24 hours. Medication may not be
            administered during program hours, therefore, do not send any in with your child.</p>
          </div>
          <span class="chalkboard__accordion__question">How can I keep up with what's going on with my child in class?</span>
          <div class="chalkboard__accordion__answer">
            <p>You will receive a calendar of events each month for you to review. Back-to-School Nights are held in
            October to give parents a chance to hear about the classroom routine and talk with the teachers without the
            children present. Periodically, teachers will send home Teacher Comments’ discussing your child’s adjustment
            to and enjoyment of the classroom routine. Parent-teacher conferences are available upon request.</p>
          </div>
          <span class="chalkboard__accordion__question">Does Creative Wonder have specialty teachers?</span>
          <div class="chalkboard__accordion__answer">
            <p>Yes we do. We have a music teacher and a Spanish teacher on our faculty. Both conduct morning classes
            Monday through Friday to provide continuity in the learning experience. Music and language experiences in the
            early years are very important.</p>
            <p>We start toddlers in our music class to encourage the appreciation of singing
            and playing and listening to instruments. Music enhances brain development, especially spatial orientation and
            the ability to think mathematically. Our music teacher also includes many movement and literacy activities
            in the class. The brain is most receptive to learning languages during early childhood. That's why we start
            two-year-old children in Spanish class.</p>

          <span class="chalkboard__accordion__question">I won't be available to pick-up my child today, so I'm arranging
          for my oldest son to pick him up. Do I need to send a note?</span>
          <div class="chalkboard__accordion__answer">
            <p>If someone else is picking up your child, you must inform Peartree in writing and in person. Send us a note
            detailing your plans, including the name of the person you are authorizing to pick-up your child and the date of
            its effectiveness. Please inform any escorts that we will check picture IDs to ensure they are authorized to pick-up
            your child. No one under the age of 18 may escort a child from Peartree. We cannot accept telephone authorizations.
            We will not send a child home with someone we do not know. Please introduce us to anyone who may be in to pick-up
            your child.</p>
